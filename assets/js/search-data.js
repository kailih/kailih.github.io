          description: "In this blog, we reproduced the work of &quot;Residual Network and Embedding Usage - New Tricks of Node Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks.&quot; and deliver a thorough introduction and analysis. In detail, we implemented the Graph Attention Network and several commonly used tricks to challenge the node classification task on the ogbn-arxiv dataset. Our experiments show satisfactory results on this dataset. At the same time, we explored the effectiveness of different tricks proposed or introduced in the paper. From our experiments, we found that Node2Vec embeddings, label usage, and C&amp;S achieved noticeable improvements on the task while changing the network structure of GAT and leveraging self-KD barely increases the accuracy.",
