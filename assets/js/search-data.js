Explored lexical, syntactic, and semantic similarity-based example selection methods, and introduced reverse ordering to enhance contextual relevance. The semantic similarity + reverse order strategy achieved the best performance (F1=0.57), yielding a 5% improvement over the random baseline. Findings highlight the impact of example amount, quality, similarity, and ordering on large language model effectiveness.",

Built on the BiToD architecture to reduce reliance on weak natural language encoders and improve slot value extraction. The work investigated the impact of history length (number of previous turns) on model performance, identified diminishing returns, and explored few-shot learning for hard examples. It is designed to improve scalability and robustness in low-resource languages.",

In detail, we implemented the Graph Attention Network and several commonly used tricks to challenge the node classification task on the ogbn-arxiv dataset. Our experiments show satisfactory results on this dataset. At the same time, we explored the effectiveness of different tricks proposed or introduced in the paper. From our experiments, we found that Node2Vec embeddings, label usage, and C&amp;S achieved noticeable improvements on the task while changing the network structure of GAT and leveraging self-KD barely increases the accuracy.",
