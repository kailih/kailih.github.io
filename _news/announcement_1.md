We are excited to announce that our latest research, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14903">ColBERT-serve: Efficient Multi-Stage Memory-Mapped Scoring</a>, was recently accepted and presented at the 47th European Conference on Information Retrieval (<a href="https://ecir2025.eu/">ECIR 2025</a>). Our work introduces a new method for making state-of-the-art neural search more efficient and scalable.
