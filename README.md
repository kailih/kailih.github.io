# Kaili Huang - Personal Professional Website

This is my personal professional website showcasing my research, publications, and professional experience in machine learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval.

## About This Site

This website is built using the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) Jekyll theme (July 2025 version), a beautiful and responsive template designed for academics. The theme was created by [Maruan Al-Shedivat](https://github.com/alshedivat) and contributors, and is licensed under the MIT License.

## Migration History

This website represents a complete migration from my previous personal website repository, which has been archived due to being based on an outdated template version. The migration involved:

- Cloning the latest al-folio template (July 2025)
- Replacing all template content with personal information
- Updating publications, projects, and professional information
- Adding new content that were not previously on my website: a complete cv and a pdf-version resume, selected github repositories, etc.

<!-- ## Local Development - for my own reference

To run this website locally:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:8080/`. -->
