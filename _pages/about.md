I am an enthusiastic machine learning engineer and researcher. My interests span natural language processing, large language models, information retrieval, multi-modality, question answering, dialog systems, etc.

I am working at <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/'>Microsoft</a> as an Applied Scientist, where I work on natural language processing and multi-modality modeling. I graduated from <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> with a master's degree in Computer Science. Before attending Stanford, I received my bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a>, and then worked at <a href="https://www.bytedance.com/en/">ByteDance</a> as a Machine Learning Engineer for 1 year.
